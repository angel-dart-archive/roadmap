# DEPRECATED
Having a roadmap of features is more practical to have in the main repo itself, and could be better implemented as a Github project, which did not exist when this repo was created.

This current repo has been stale for a long time, and might be misleading to people, as at the time of this writing, still indicates Angel as being in beta, when in reality it has been `1.0.0`+ since early 2017.

# The Angel Framework

[![version: v1.0.0-beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/pub-v1.0.0--beta-blue.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/angel_common)

*The above badge will turn green once all planned features are implemented.*

There are a few server-side frameworks rising within Dart at this moment, but Angel has a different goal than all the rest.
Angel aims to be a server-side framework optimized for full-stack development. Angel users should be able to write both
their backends and frontends entirely in Dart, and share as much code across each platform as possible.

For this to work, Angel must be *flexible*, and have a *low learning curve*. Thus, the basic API is modeled after Express, and
new functionality is added via plug-ins.

The final goal of Angel is *scalability*. As your application grows, Angel aims to continue working, with little or no change in
server-side configuration.
