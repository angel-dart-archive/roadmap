# Filing Issues

Firstly, thank you for your help! Without you, it would be impossible for Angel to achieve its goals. 

Please file issues in the [Roadmap repo](https://github.com/angel-dart/roadmap). When filing an issue, please use the following form:

```
Title: <name of plugin>:<description of problem>

Body:
  Angel version:
  Steps to reproduce error:
  Error message, stack trace and output (if available)
  How urgently do you need the issue to be fixed?
```


# Pull Requests
To submit a PR, you *must* [submit an issue](#filing-issues) beforehand, and wait until it receives the `slated` tag.
Afterwards, include the following in the body:

```
Title: Brief description of changes made
Issue it resolves:
```

# Plugins
If you make a custom plugin, consider [submitting a new issue](#filing-issues), titled "New plugin: (plugin name)."
It would be great to have all Angel plugins within the organization, so if it receives the `slated` tag, please
add @thosakwe as a collaborator, and transfer the repository into this organization.
